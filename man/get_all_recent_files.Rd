\title{Get all recent DESEZONIRANJE file paths}
\usage{
get_all_recent_files()
}
\value{
Named character vector of file paths. Names correspond to entries
  in `desezoniranje_config`. Failed lookups are omitted from the result
  and reported via warning.
}
\description{
Finds the most recent Excel file for each data source configured in
`desezoniranje_config`. Uses `find_most_recent_file()` for each entry
with graceful error handling - failures are reported as warnings but
don't stop execution.
}
\details{
This function wraps `find_most_recent_file()` with `purrr::safely()` to
handle network drive issues or missing files. If any lookups fail, a
warning lists the failed table names, but successful lookups are still
returned.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
file_paths <- get_all_recent_files()
names(file_paths)  # Shows which data sources were successfully located
}
